These are the directions for adding .jar files to the designer.  This follows best practices.


Assuming you have BD Pro in C:\Actuate\BDPro, the following steps will give you the location to put plugins and ODA’s:

1.       Create directory C:\Actuate\BDPro\eclipse\links
2.       Copy both files in the links.zip file to the links directory (paths in the files are specific to your path).
3.       Create directory C:\Actuate\BDPro\MyClasses\eclipse\plugins
4.       Create directory C:\Actuate\BDPro\oda\eclipse\plugins

If the designer was running, you’ll have to restart before this will take effect.  Obviously you’ll have to restart after adding plugins here.
