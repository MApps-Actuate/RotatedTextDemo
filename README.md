RotatedTextDemo
===============

The RotatedTextDemo illustrates how a BIRT ReportItem plugin is created and deployed. Any BIRT developer with Java skills that is looking to extend BIRT with their own component will be interested in this project. This demo differs from others in how it highlights the BIRT extension capabilities when creating a custom BIRT ReportItem plugin. This is a great example to show how easy it is to create and add your own ReportItem's to BIRT.
